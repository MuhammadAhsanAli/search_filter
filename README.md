## Usage

- Access the application in your browser.
- Use the `/customers` URL to filter customers by email, order number, or item name.

## Approach

The search functionality is implemented by leveraging Laravelâ€™s Eloquent ORM to handle relationships between customers, orders, and items. Eager loading is used to minimize database queries, and only the necessary columns are selected to optimize performance. The search filters are applied using `whereHas` and `where` clauses, ensuring that the queries remain efficient even with large datasets. Pagination is added to further improve the performance and user experience by breaking down the results into manageable pages.
